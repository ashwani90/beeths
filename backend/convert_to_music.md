To convert a **MIDI file to actual music** (i.e., realistic audio), you can use **software that renders MIDI through virtual instruments or sound libraries**. Here's a breakdown based on what you're trying to do:

---

## 🎧 Convert MIDI to Realistic Music (Audio)

### 🔹 1. **DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations)** — 🥇 Best for Quality

These let you import MIDI, assign realistic instrument sounds (VSTs), and export as WAV/MP3:

| DAW              | OS                  | Features                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **FL Studio**    | Windows/macOS       | Easy MIDI editing, good instrument support |
| **Ableton Live** | Windows/macOS       | Real-time performance, great synths        |
| **Logic Pro X**  | macOS               | Top-quality built-in instruments           |
| **Reaper**       | Windows/macOS/Linux | Lightweight, powerful, very affordable     |
| **LMMS**         | Windows/macOS/Linux | Free, beginner-friendly                    |

> 🔌 With any DAW, pair MIDI with **virtual instruments (VST plugins)** like:
>
> * **LABS by Spitfire** (free realistic piano/strings)
> * **Kontakt** (premium orchestral/piano sounds)
> * **Pianoteq** (realistic physical modeling piano)
> * **NotePerformer** (for classical scoring)

### 🔹 2. **Notation Software** — Best for Sheet Music + Playback

These tools show sheet music and play MIDI with high-quality sounds:

| Software      | OS  | Notes                                  |
| ------------- | --- | -------------------------------------- |
| **MuseScore** | All | Free, good playback, export MP3        |
| **Sibelius**  | All | Industry standard for scores           |
| **Finale**    | All | Professional engraving + playback      |
| **Dorico**    | All | Best for orchestral/classical playback |

> ✅ Most allow exporting audio (WAV/MP3) from your MIDI.

### 🔹 3. **Online Tools** — Fast and Easy

If you want **no install**, use:

* [🎼 Flat.io](https://flat.io) — Upload MIDI, see sheet music, play it
* [🎵 Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net) — Play and edit MIDI online
* [🎹 SoundFont MIDI Player](https://bitmidi.com/player) — Basic playback

### 🔹 4. **Python (Programmatic)** — For Automation

If you're coding, you can render MIDI to WAV like this:

#### Using `fluidsynth` and a SoundFont:

```bash
sudo apt install fluidsynth
```

```bash
fluidsynth -ni soundfont.sf2 your_song.mid -F output.wav -r 44100
```

You’ll need a SoundFont file like [FluidR3](https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/index.html).

Or in Python:

```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run([
    'fluidsynth', '-ni', 'soundfont.sf2', 'song.mid',
    '-F', 'output.wav', '-r', '44100'
])
```

## 🎁 Recommendation for You

Since you're working with **Beethoven-style MIDI generation**, here’s the ideal setup:

| Task                             | Tool                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Edit MIDI or generate variations | Python (Magenta) or DAW                                      |
| Hear realistic audio             | **MuseScore (free)** or **Reaper (cheap)**                   |
| High-quality rendering           | **Kontakt**, **Spitfire LABS**, or **Pianoteq** inside a DAW |
| Export WAV/MP3                   | Your DAW or MuseScore                                        |
